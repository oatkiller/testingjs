h1. Description

Testing.js is a very simple testing framework that has no external dependencies. It is very lightweight. It can run in browser or non-browser JavaScript environments. Use it to test your JavaScript code.

h1. Structure

Testing.js has several classes:

# *Runner*: logs test failures and successes with its registered listeners
# *Suite*: Organizes related tests, runs setUp and tearDown functions before and after each test run, and reports to a Runner
# *Test*: consists of a message and a test. Calls Asserts to test your code
# *Assert*: Throw failure errors when code doesn't work as expected. These errors are caught and passed to the Runner, which logs them
